<b id="title">Karel&#39;s World</b>
		 			
<p> Karel&#39;s world is defined by streets running horizontally (east-west) and avenues running
vertically (north-south). The intersection of a street and an avenue is called a corner.
Karel can only be positioned on corners and must be facing one of the four standard
compass directions (north, south, east, west). A sample Karel world is shown below. Here
Karel is located at the corner of 1st Street and 1st Avenue, facing east.

<p> Several other components of Karel&#39;s world can be seen in this example. The object in
front of Karel is a beeper. Karel can detect and pick up a beeper if it is on the same
corner. The solid lines in the diagram are walls. Walls serve as barriers within Karel&#39;s
world. Karel cannot walk through walls. Karel&#39;s world
is always bounded by walls along the edges, but the world may have different dimensions
depending on the specific problem Karel needs to solve.
</p>        

<p> An important note about Karel&#39;s world is that we are looking at it from a bird&#39;s eye
view (even though for artistic purposes Karel is drawn as if we were looking at the world
from the side). In Karel&#39;s current configuration there is a wall on Karel&#39;s right.
