<b id="title">Iteration</b>
		  <p>In solving Karel problems, you will often find that repetition is essential. To see how repetition can be used in the context of a program, consider
the problem of Karel filling potholes for a stylized roadway with potholes at every even-numbered avenue:</p></ul> 
<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img SRC="./images/road.PNG" ALT="Sample World" align="center"/>
</div> 
<p>Our mission is to write a program that instructs Karel to fill all the holes in this road.
Since you know that in this problem there are <b>exactly</b> four holes to fill, the control
statement that you need is a for loop, which specifies that you want to repeat some
operation a predetermined number of times. The structure of the for statement appears
complicated primarily because it is actually much more powerful than anything Karel
needs. The only version of the for syntax that Karel uses is</p>

<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; i < <em>count</em>; i++) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements to be repeated</em> <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p>where <em>count</em> is an integer indicating the number of repetitions. In english this translates into: repeat the code between the curly brackets <em>count</em> times. Here is an example program that would make karel move forward 10 times:</p>

<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move(); <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
