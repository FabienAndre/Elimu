<b id="title">First Program</b>
		  <p>
Now that we know Karel's four commands, the next step is to string together commands into a runnable program. Here's an example of what that looks like:</p>
<br/>

<!-- start code, karel and run buttons -->
<div id ="indented">
<textarea name="code" id="code">
/* This program defines a "run" 
 * function with three commands. */

function run() {
    move();
    pickBeeper();
    move();
}</textarea>
<canvas name="canvas" id="canvas">firstProgram.w,280,170,first</canvas>    
<br/><br/>
<div float="left">
	Run:
	<button type='button' id='interactor' onClick='application.runButton()'>
		<IMG SRC="./images/playButton.png" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30 ALT="run" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
	</button>
	&nbsp;
	<button type='button' id='interactor' onClick='application.stopButton()'>
		<IMG SRC="./images/stopButton.png" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30 ALT="run" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
	</button>
</div> 
</div>
<!-- end code, karel and run buttons -->

<p>The first important part in this program is the "comments" section. Comments in both Karel and JavaScript begin with the characters <b id="codeText2">/*</b> and end with the characters <b id="codeText2">*/</b>. Everything within the comment section (green text) is ignored by the computer and is there to document the program for human readers.</p>

<p>The rest of the program represent the definition of a new function with the name <b id="codeText2">run</b>. the function definition consists of two parts: The first line constitutes the function header and the code between the curly braces is the
function body. The special JavaScript word <b id="codeText2">function</b> followed by the word <b id="codeText2">run</b> tells the computer that a new function is being defined that can be called with the name run. For now you can think of the parens after the word run as a bit of syntax that goes with defining functions. The commands that are in the body describe what the computer will execute (in order) when the <b id="codeText2">run</b> function is called. All commands in the body are followed by a semi-colon.</p>

<p>In Karel the <b id="codeText2">run</b> function will always be the entry function that the computer steps through when you execute your program (hit the green play button).</p>
