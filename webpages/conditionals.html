<b id="title">Conditionals</b>
		  <p>
So far our programs have followed a strictly linear, step-by-step order of operations. Conditional statements make it
possible for Karel to examine its world and change its execution pattern accordingly. To control the flow of the program based on an observation Karel can make 
about the world, we can use the <b id="codeText2">if</b> statement, which ordinarily appears in the following form:</p>
<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (<em>conditional test</em>) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>statements to be executed only if the condition is true</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p>The conditional test shown in the first line of this pattern must be replaced by one of the
tests Karel can perform on its environment. The result of that conditional test is either
true or false. If the test is true, Karel executes the statements enclosed in braces; if the test
is false, Karel does nothing. </p>

<p>Every condition has a corresponding opposite. For example, you can use either the <b id="codeText2">frontIsClear</b> condition 
or the <b id="codeText2">frontIsBlocked</b> condition. Here is a list of the test's Karel can perform on the world:</p></ul>
