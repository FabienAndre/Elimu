<b id="title">Defining New Functions</b>
		  <p>Even though the Turn Right program demonstrates that it is possible to
perform the turnRight operation using only Karel&#39;s built-in commands, the resulting
code is not particularly clear conceptually. The fact that you have to use three
<b id="codeText2">turnLeft</b> commands to do so is annoying. It would be much simpler if you could simply
say <b id="codeText2">turnRight</b>. </p>

<p>Fortunately, JavaScript makes it possible to define new
commands simply by including new function definitions. Whenever you have a sequence
of Karel commands that performs some useful task, such as turning right, you can
define a new function that executes that sequence of commands when called. The format for defining a
new Karel function is much the same as the definition of run in the preceding examples,
which is a function definition in its own right. A typical function definition looks like this:</p>

<div id = "indent">
	<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function <em>name</em>() {<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>commands that make up the body of the method</em><br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
</div>

<p>In this pattern, name represents the name you have chosen for the new method. To
complete the definition, all you have to do is provide the sequence of commands in the
lines between the curly braces. For example, you can define <b id="codeText2">turnRight</b> as follows:</p>
<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function turnRight() {<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/></p>
<p>If you provide the above definition of <b id="codeText2">turnRight</b> in your program code, the method is added to the list of Karel 
commands. So you can now call it like <b id="codeText2">turnLeft</b>!</p>
<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function run() {<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnRight();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/></p>
