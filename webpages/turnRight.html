<b id="title">Turning Right</b>
		  <p>One interesting facet of Karel that you may have noticed is that Kare&#39;s language includes a <b id="codeText2">turnLeft</b> command, but no <b id="codeText2">turnRight</b>
command. It&#39s as if you bought the economy model and have now discovered that it is
missing some important features. Lets say you needed to write a program that accomplished the task of making Karel face
South: </p>

<center>
<div style="text-align: center; width:500px">
<div style="float:left;">
Before<br/>
<img SRC="./images/turnRightBefore.png" ALT="Before" align="center"/>
</div>
<div>
After<br/>
<img SRC="./images/turnRightAfter.png" ALT="Before" align="center"/>
</div>
</div>
</center>

<p>At this point, you have your first opportunity to begin thinking like a programmer. You
have one set of commands, but not exactly the set you need. What can you do? Can you
accomplish the effect of a <b id="codeText2">turnRight</b> command using only the capabilities you have? 
The answer, of course, is yes. You can accomplish the effect of turning right by turning
left three times. After three left turns, Karel will be facing in the desired direction. 
A complete implementation of a Turn Right program that accomplishes the task is shown below.</p>

<div id = "indent">
	<p id="codeText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function run() {<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnLeft();<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
</div>
