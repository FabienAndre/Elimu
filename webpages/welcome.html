<p>The purpose of this website is to teach you the fundamentals of programming. Karel was developed 
	at Stanford University as a tool to teach programming to
	first time computer scientists. This website encapsulates the first week and a half
	of the current Stanford programming abstractions course.</p>

<p>Karel is a very simple robot living in a very simple 
world. By giving Karel a set of commands, you can direct it to perform certain tasks 
within its world. The process of specifying those commands is called programming. From this website you will
learn the fundamentals of programatic thinking and JavaScript (the language used to program this site, Facebook etc).
